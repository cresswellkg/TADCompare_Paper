- **Supplementary Figure 3. Visualization of different types of boundary score patterns.** (A) Patterns of raw boundary scores are shown for 5 different types of differential boundaries (Merge, split, complex, shifted, and strength change). The red horizontal line corresponds to the user-adjustable cutoff for a boundary. Human neural progenitor cells (NPCs), chr22, most representative examples are shown. (B) TADCompare::DiffPlot differential boundary visualization between NPCs and mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), chr4:10500000-18600000. 40kb resolution data from [@Schmitt:2016aa].
